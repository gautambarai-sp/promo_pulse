## 🏗️ Architecture

### New Functions Added to `app.py`

#### `load_custom_datasets()`
```python
def load_custom_datasets(products_file, stores_file, sales_file, inventory_file, issues_file=None):
    """Load custom datasets from uploaded files"""
```
- **Purpose:** Load CSV files from file uploader objects
- **Validates:** Required columns and data structure
- **Returns:** Tuple of dataframes or error message
- **Error Handling:** Returns specific error messages for debugging

### Modified Functions

#### `main()` Function
- Added data source selection logic at the start
- Conditional data loading based on user selection
- Session state management for data persistence
- Enhanced UI with dataset information

### Session State Management
- `st.session_state.dark_mode`: Persists across reruns
- File uploader keys unique for state management
- Data preserved during simulation runs

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

### For Users - Using Pre-Built Data
1. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Default "📁 Pre-Built Dataset" is selected
3. All features immediately available
4. Click "🚀 Launch Simulation" in sidebar

### For Users - Using Custom Data
1. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run app.py`
2. In sidebar, select "📤 Upload Custom Data"
3. Upload 4 required CSV files
4. See validation status (✅ or ❌)
5. Dataset information shows row counts
6. Click "🚀 Launch Simulation" in sidebar

### For Developers - Testing Custom Upload
1. Run sample generator: `python create_sample_dataset.py`
2. This creates: sample_products.csv, sample_stores.csv, sample_sales.csv, sample_inventory.csv
3. Upload these files to test the feature
4. All dashboard features should work normally

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow

```
User Selection
     ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Pre-Built Data?        │
├──────────┬──────────────┤
│   YES    │      NO      │
↓          ↓
load_data() → load_custom_datasets()

            ↓
    initialize_simulator()
            ↓
    Display Dashboard
```

### Validation Logic

```python
Required Columns Check:
  ✓ All required columns present?
    ↓ YES: Continue
    ↓ NO: Return error with missing columns
  
Data Integrity Check:
  ✓ Foreign keys valid? (product_id, store_id exist)
  ✓ No critical nulls in required fields?
  ✓ Data types correct?
    ↓ YES: Load data
    ↓ NO: Return specific error
```

### Error Messages

Clear error hierarchy:
1. **Column Validation Error**: "Products missing columns: {'unit_cost_aed'}"
2. **File Upload Error**: "Please upload all required files"
3. **Data Load Error**: "Error loading files: [specific error]"
4. **Foreign Key Error**: Handled during simulator initialization

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Products missing columns: {'unit_cost_aed'}"**
- Solution: Add unit_cost_aed column to products CSV

**"Please upload all required files"**
- Solution: Make sure all 4 files are uploaded (Issues is optional)

**No data visible in dashboard**
- Check: Foreign key relationships between tables
- Check: Preset filters haven't filtered out all data
- Try: "Custom" preset with broader filters

**Simulation fails**
- Check: Data quality issues (negative stock, invalid dates)
- Try: Pre-built data to confirm dashboard works
- Check: CSV file encoding is UTF-8
