## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Requirements
- All 4 files must have required columns
- Issues file is optional
- CSV format only (no Excel, JSON, etc.)
- UTF-8 encoding recommended

### Limitations
- File upload size limit (varies by system)
- Large datasets (>1M rows) may be slow
- Data stays in memory (not persisted)
- Must re-upload after dashboard restart

### Best Practices
- Test with small dataset first
- Validate IDs across files match
- Use consistent date formats
- Keep original data as backup
- Document any data transformations
